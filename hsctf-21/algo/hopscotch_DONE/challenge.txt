Keith wants to play hopscotch, but in order to make things interesting, 
he decides to use a random number generator to decide the number of squares n to draw for a round of hopscotch. 
He then creates a hopscotch board on the floor by randomly creating a sequence of ones (one square) and twos (two squares) 
such that the sum of all the numbers in the sequence is n. Given 1 <= n <= 1000, 
find the number of valid hopscotch boards (mod 10000) he can create.
