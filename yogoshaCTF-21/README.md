1. Welcome_Christmas
```
Yogosha{Shisui_H4s_G00d_ViSion}
```

2. Uchiha_Or_Evil_?
Hint : `Is using hashes that way always secure ? Shisui is not sure about that since the old state of a hash is saved` 
```
Yogosha{Master_Of_ArbitraRy_ReAdiNg_JuTsu}
```

3. Js_and_Uchiha_Are_Evils
Hint : ```
I heard that there is totally 10000 articles,this number will really help if you focus closely on the used functions :D /jutsu/1 is handy if you haven't seen it \o/
This check is done at the first line: `if (/^[\b\t\n\v\f\r \xa0]*-/.test(req.params.id)) {` Is checking negative jutsus is safely done ?
I like injections and blind extractions :D 1337 is a nice number though, ypu may need it at last
```
