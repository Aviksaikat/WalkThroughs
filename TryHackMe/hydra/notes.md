Notes on Hydra form THM Room
***What is Hydra?***
```
Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program; a quick system login password 'hacking' tool.

We can use Hydra to run through a list and 'bruteforce' some authentication service. Imagine trying to manually guess someones password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.

Hydra has the ability to bruteforce the following protocols: Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP,  HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.

For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra, read the official Kali Hydra tool page: https://en.kali.tools/?p=220

This shows the importance of using a strong password, if your password is common, doesn't contain special characters and/or is not above 8 characters, its going to be prone to being guessed. 100 million password lists exist containing common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to login, make sure to change it from the default! Often CCTV camera's and web frameworks use admin:password as the default password, which is obviously not strong enough.

******Hydra Commands***
```
The options we pass into Hydra depends on which service (protocol) we're attacking. For example if we wanted to bruteforce FTP with the username being user and a password list being passlist.txt, we'd use the following command:

hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP

For the purpose of this deployed machine, here are the commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method).
SSH

﻿hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh

Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to bruteforce web forms too, you will have to make sure you know which type of request its making - a GET or POST methods are normally used. You can use your browsers network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types, or simply view the source code.

Below is an example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V

```
