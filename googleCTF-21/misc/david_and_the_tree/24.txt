ALONG IN APRIL, GADSBY SAT FINISHING HIS MORNING TOAST AS A BOY,
RUSHING IN, PUT A "POST" ON HIS LAP WITH A WILD, BOYISH GASP OF:--"_MY
GOSH_, MAYOR GADSBY, _LOOK!!_" AND GADSBY SAW A WORD ABOUT A FOOT HIGH.
IT WAS W--A--R. LADY GADSBY SAW IT ALSO, SLOWLY SINKING INTO A CHAIR.
AT THAT INSTANT BOTH NANCY AND KATHLYN BURST FRANTICALLY IN, NANCY
LUGGING BABY LILLIAN, NOW ALMOST TWO, AND A BIG LOAD FOR SO SMALL A
WOMAN, NANCY GASPING OUT:--

"DADDY!! MUST BILL AND JULIUS AND FRANK AND JOHN,----"

GADSBY PUT DOWN HIS "POST" AND, PULLING NANCY DOWN ONTO HIS LAP, SAID:--

"NANCY DARLING, BILL AND JULIUS AND FRANK AND JOHN MUST. OLD GLORY IS
CALLING, BABY, AND NO BRANTON HILLS BOY WILL BALK AT _THAT_ CALL. IT'S
AWFUL, BUT IT'S A FACT, NOW."

LADY GADSBY SAID NOTHING, BUT NANCY AND KATHLYN SAW AN ASHY PALLOR
ON THAT MATRONLY BROW; AND GADSBY GOING OUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIS
CUSTOMARY KISS.

FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AN INSTANT, BRANTON HILLS, IN BLANK, BLACK
GLOOM, STOOD STOCK STILL. BUT NOT FOR LONG. DAYS GOT TO FLASHING PAST,
WITH THAT AWFUL SIGHT OF GIRLS, OUT TO LUNCH, SAYING:--

"FOUR FROM OUR SHOP; AND THAT BIG COTTON MILL HAS _FORTY-SIX_ WHO WILL
GO."

WITH VIRGINIA SAYING:--

"ABOUT ALL THAT OUR BOYS TALK ABOUT IS UNIFORMS, PAY, TRANSPORTATION,
ARMY CORPS, DIVISIONS, NAVAL SQUADRONS, AND SO ON."

AN OCCASIONAL BRANTON HILLS POLITICIAN THOUGHT THAT IT "MIGHT BLOW OUT
IN A MONTH OR TWO;" BUT YOUR HISTORIAN KNOWS THAT IT DIDN'T; ALL OF
THAT "BLOWING" CONSISTING OF BLASTS FROM THAT MILITARY CLARION, CALLING
FOR MOBILIZATION.

       *       *       *       *       *

DAYS! DAYS! DAYS! FINALLY, ON MAY FOURTH, THAT DAY OF TINY NANCY'S BIG
CHURCH RITUAL, YOU KNOW; THAT DAY, UPON WHICH ANY WOMAN WOULD LOOK BACK
WITH ROMANTIC JOY, NANCY, WITH KATHLYN, LADY GADSBY AND HIS HONOR,
STOOD AT BRANTON HILLS' BIG RAILWAY STATION, AT WHICH OUR MUNICIPAL
BAND WAS DRAWN UP; IN BACK OF WHICH STOOD, IN SOLID RANKS, THIS CITY'S
GRAND YOUNG MANHOOD, BILL, JULIUS, FRANK, JOHN, PAUL AND NORMAN
STANDING JUST AS STRAIGHT AND RIGID AS ANY. AS THAT LONG, LONG TROOP
TRAIN GOT ITS SIGNAL TO START,--BUT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT SUCH SIGHTS,
GOING ON DAILY, FROM OUR PACIFIC COAST TO ATLANTIC DOCKS.

AS IT SHOT AROUND A TURN, AND GADSBY WAS WALKING SADLY TOWARD CITY
HALL, A GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOY HURRYING UP TO HIM SAID:--

"_WOW!!_ I WISH _I_ COULD GO TO WAR!"

"HI!" SAID GADSBY. "IF IT ISN'T KID BANKS!"

"AW! CUT THAT KID STUFF! I'M _ALLAN_ BANKS! SON OF _COUNCILMAN_ BANKS!"

"OH, PARDON. BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR, BOY."

"_AW! I DO TOO!!_"

"BUT YOUNG BOYS _CAN'T_ GO TO WAR."

"I KNOW THAT; AND I WISH THIS WILL LAST UNTIL I GROW SO I _CAN_ GO.
IT'S JUST GRAND! A BIG CANNON SAYS _BOOM! BOOM!_ AND,--"

"SIT DOWN ON THIS WALL, BOY. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU."

"ALL RIGHT. SHOOT!"

"NOW LOOK, ALLAN. IF THIS WAR SHOULD LAST UNTIL YOU GROW UP, JUST THINK
OF HOW MANY _THOUSANDS_ OF TROOPS IT WOULD KILL. HOW MANY GRAND, GOOD
LADS IT WOULD PUT RIGHT OUT OF THIS WORLD."

"GOSH! THAT'S SO, AIN'T IT! I DIDN'T THINK OF GUYS DYIN'."

"BUT A MAN _HAS_ TO THINK OF THAT, ALLAN. AND _YOU_ WILL, AS YOU GROW
UP. MY TWO BIG SONS JUST PUT OFF ON THAT BIG TROOP TRAIN. I DON'T KNOW
_HOW_ LONG BILL AND JULIUS WILL STAY AWAY. YOUR BIG CANNON MIGHT GO
_BOOM!_ AND HIT BILL OR JULIUS. DO YOU KNOW FRANK MORGAN, PAUL JOHNSON
AND JOHN SMITH? ALL RIGHT; THAT BIG CANNON MIGHT HIT THAT TRIO, TOO.
NOBODY CAN SAY _WHO_ A CANNON WILL HIT, ALLAN. NOW, YOU GO RIGHT ON
THROUGH GRAMMAR SCHOOL, AND GROW UP INTO A BIG STRONG MAN, AND DON'T
THINK ABOUT WAR;" AND GADSBY, STANDING AND GAZING FAR OFF TO BRANTON
HILLS' CHARMING HILL DISTRICT, THOUGHT: "I THINK _THAT_ WILL BUST UP A
WILD YOUNG AMBITION!"

BUT THAT KID, TURNING BACK, SANG OUT:--

"SAY!! IF THIS SCRAP STOPS, AND A _BIG_ WAR STARTS,--_AHA_, BOY! YOU
JUST WATCH ALLAN BANKS! SON OF COUNCILMAN BANKS!!" AND A SMALL FIST WAS
POUNDING VICIOUSLY ON AN ALSO SMALL BOSOM.

"BY GOLLY!" SAID GADSBY, WALKING AWAY, "THAT'S TOMORROW TALKING!"

       *       *       *       *       *

SO NOW THIS HISTORY WILL DRIFT ALONG; ALONG THROUGH DAYS AND MONTHS;
DAYS AND MONTHS OF THAT AWFUL GNAWING DOUBT; ACTUALLY A PARADOX, FOR
IT WAS A "CONSCIOUS COMA;" MORNINGS ON WHICH BRANTON HILLS' ICY BLOOD
SHRANK FROM LOOKING AT OUR CITY'S "POST," FOR ITS CASUALTY LIST WAS
RAPIDLY--TOO RAPIDLY,--GROWING. DAYS AND DAYS OF OUR GIRLHOOD AND
WOMANHOOD ROLLING THOUSANDS OF LONG, NARROW COTTON STRIPS; PACKING
LOVING GIFTS FROM MANY A PANTRY; NANCY AND KATHLYN THINKING CONSTANTLY
OF FRANK AND JOHN; LUCY ALMOST DOWN AND OUT FROM WORRYING ABOUT PAUL;
KATHLYN KNOWING JUST HOW JULIUS IS MISSING HIS HALL OF NATURAL HISTORY,
AND HOW ITS STAFF IS PRAYING FOR HIM; NANCY'S RADIO SHUT DOWN _TIGHT_,
FOR SO MUCH AS A THOUGHT OF STATION KBH WAS AS A THRUST OF A SWORD.
DAYS. DAYS. DAYS OF SHOUTING ORATORS, BLARING BANDS, TROOPS FROM FAR
AWAY PAUSING AT OUR BIG RAILWAY STATION, AS GIRLS, GOING THROUGH LONG
TRAINS OF CARS, TOOK DOUGHNUTS AND HOT DRINKS. IN GADSBY'S PARLOR
WINDOW HUNG THAT FAMOUS "WORLD WAR FLAG" OF NOTHING BUT STARS; NOBODY
KNOWING AT WHAT INSTANT A _GOLD_ STAR WOULD SHOW UPON IT. A STAR FOR
BILL; A STAR FOR JULIUS. AH, BILL! BRANTON HILLS' FOP! BILL GADSBY NOW
IN AN ILL-FITTING AND UN-STYLISH KHAKI UNIFORM.

GADBY'S MANSION HAD NO BRILLIANT NIGHT LIGHTS, NOW; JUST HIS PARLOR
LAMP AND A SMALL LIGHT OR TWO IN HALLWAYS OR ON STAIRWAYS. ONLY OUR
MAYOR AND HIS LADY, NOW WORRYING, WORRYING, WORRYING; BUT BOTH OF GOOD,
STAUNCH OLD COLONIAL STOCK; AND "CARRYING ON" WITH GOOD OLD PLYMOUTH
ROCK STABILITY; AND NANCY'S BABY, LILLIAN, TOO YOUNG TO ASK WHY GRANDMA
"WASN'T HUNGRY," NOW; AND DIDN'T LAUGH SO MUCH.

KATHLYN GOT INTO OUR BIG HOSPITAL, THIS STUDIOUS YOUNG LADY'S FAMOUS
BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPIC ABILITY HOLDING OUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MOST
PRACTICAL WORK; FOR BRANTON HILLS' SHOT-TORN BOYS WOULD SOON START
DRIFTING IN. AND THUS IT WAS; WITH LUCY, SARAH AND VIRGINIA INSPIRING
BRANTON HILLS' WOMANHOOD TO KNIT, KNIT, KNIT! YOU SAW KNITTING ON MANY
A PORCH; KNITTING IN RAILWAY TRAINS; KNITTING DURING BAND MUSIC IN CITY
PARK; KNITTING IN SHADY ARBORS OUT AT OUR BIG ZOO; AT MANY A WOMAN'S
CLUB,--AND,--_ACTUALLY_, KNITTING _IN CHURCH!!_ FINALLY A BIG FACTORY,
DOWN BY OUR RAILWAY STATION, PUT OUT A CALL FOR "ANYBODY, MAN OR WOMAN,
WHO WANTS TO WORK ON MUNITIONS;" AND MANY A DAINTY BRANTON HILLS GIRL
SAT AT BIG, UNFAMILIAR STAMPING, PUNCHING, GRINDING, OR POLISHING
OUTFITS; TIRING FRAIL YOUNG BACKS AND STRAINING SOFT YOUNG HANDS;
KNOWING THAT THIS FACTORY'S OUTPUT MIGHT,--AND PROBABLY WOULD,--ROB A
WOMAN ACROSS THAT BIG ATLANTIC OF A HUSBAND OR SON,--BUT, STILL, IT IS
WAR!

GADSBY, SMOKING ON HIS IVY-CLAD PORCH, AS HIS LADY WAS INDUSTRIOUSLY
KNITTING, SAID, IN A SORT OF SOLILOQUY:--

"WAR! THAT AWFUL CONDITION WHICH A FAMOUS MILITARY MAN IN COMMAND OF A
DIVISION, LONG AGO, SAID WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH SATAN AND ALL HIS COHORTS!
WAR! THAT AWFUL CONDITION OF HUMAN MINDS COMING DOWN FROM WAY, _WAY_
BACK OF ALL HISTORY; THAT VAST VOID DURING WHICH SYMPATHY WAS NOT
KNOWN; DURING WHICH ANIMALS FOUGHT WITH TOOTH, CLAW OR HORN; THAT VAST
VOID DURING WHICH WOUNDS HAD NO SOOTHING BALM, UNTIL THIRST, AGONY OR A
FINAL SWOON LAID LOW A GIGANTIC MAMMOTH, OR A TINY, GASPING FAWN! BUT
NOW, AGAIN, IN THIS GRAND DAY OF MAN'S MAGICALLY GROWING BRAIN, THIS
DAY OF KINDLY CROONING TO INFANTS IN CRIBS; KINDLY TALKS TO BOYS AND
GIRLS IN SCHOOL; AND BLOOD-TINGLING ORATIONS FROM THOUSANDS OF PULPITS
UPON THAT HOLY COMMAND: 'THOU SHALT NOT KILL,' NOW, _AGAIN_, MAN IS OUT
TO KILL HIS OWN KIND." AND LADY GADSBY COULD ONLY SIGH.
