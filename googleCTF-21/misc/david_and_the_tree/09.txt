NOW I'LL DROP CIVIC AFFAIRS FOR A BIT, AND GO ON TO A MOST NATURAL
ACT IN THIS CITY OF MANY YOUNG CHAPS AND CHARMING YOUNG GIRLS WHICH
WAS SLOWLY WORKING UP ALL THROUGH THIS HISTORY, AS MAYOR GADSBY HAD
OCCASION TO FIND OUT, SITTING COMFORTABLY ON HIS PORCH ON A HOT, SULTRY
AUGUST NIGHT. AMIDST BLOSSOMING SHRUBS, A DIM FORM SLOWLY TROD UP HIS
WINDING PATHWAY. IT WAS A YOUNG MAN, PLAINLY TRYING TO ACT CALMLY, BUT
COULDN'T. IT WAS FRANK MORGAN, OUR RADIO BROADCASTING "BOSS", YOU KNOW,
WHO, FOR MANY A MONTH, HAD SHOWN WHAT A ROMANTIC PUBLIC CALLS "A CRUSH"
FOR GADSBY'S YOUNG NANCY.

SO A JOLLY CALL OF:--"WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, BOY?" RANG OUT, AS FRANK
SANK WILTINGLY INTO A HAMMOCK, WIPING HIS BROW OF WHAT I _ACTUALLY_
KNOW WAS _NOT_ NATURAL HUMIDITY FROM AN AUGUST NIGHT! NOW GADSBY, WHO
WAS, AS I SAID, A GAY LOTHARIO IN HIS OWN YOUTH, SAW RIGHT OFF WHAT
WAS COMING, AND SAT BACK, WAITING. FINALLY, FINISHING A BAD ATTACK OF
COUGHING, (THOUGH FRANK HADN'T ANY COLD!), THAT YOUNG MAN SAID:--

"I,--THAT IS, NANCY AND I,--OR, I WILL SAY THAT I WANT TO,--THAT IS,--I
THINK NANCY AND I WOULD--" AND GADSBY TOOK PITY ON HIM, RIGHT OFF.

NANCY HAD ALWAYS HAD A STRONG LIKING FOR FRANK. BOTH HAD GROWN UP IN
BRANTON HILLS FROM BABYHOOD; AND GADSBY THOUGHT BACK ABOUT THAT LASSO
WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM LADY GADSBY. NOW ASKING A GIRL'S DAD FOR THAT
YOUNG LADY'S HAND IS NO SNAP FOR ANY YOUNG SWAIN; AND GADSBY WAS JUST
THAT KIND OF A DAD WHO WOULD SMOOTH OUT ANY BUMPS OR ROUGH SPOTS IN
SUCH A YOUNG SWAIN'S PATH. NANCY WASN'T A CHILD, NOW, BUT A GROWN-UP
YOUNG WOMAN; SO GADSBY SAID:--

"FRANK, LADY GADSBY AND I KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU THINK OF NANCY;
AND WHAT NANCY THINKS OF YOU. SO, IF YOU WANT TO MARRY, OUR FULL WISH
IS FOR A LONG AND HAPPY UNION. NANCY IS OUT IN THAT ARBOR, DOWN THIS
BACK PATH; AND I'LL WATCH THAT NOBODY DISTURBS YOU TWO FOR AN HOUR."

AT THIS GRAND TURN OF AFFAIRS, FRANK COULD ONLY GASP:--"OH-H-H!!" AND
A SHADOWY FORM SHOT DOWN THAT DUSKY PATH; AND FROM THAT MOONLIT ARBOR,
ANYBODY KNOWING HOW A MAN CHIRPS TO A CANARY BIRD, WOULD KNOW THAT TWO
YOUNG BIRDS PUT A BINDING APPROVAL UPON WHAT HIS HONOR HAD JUST SAID!!

MANY A MAN HAS KNOWN THAT STARTLING INSTANT IN WHICH DAN CUPID, THAT
BUSY YOUNG RASCAL, TOOK THINGS IN HAND, AND TOLD HIM THAT HIS BABY
GIRL WAS NOT A BABY GIRL NOW, AND WAS ABOUT TO FLY AWAY FROM HIM. IT
IS BOTH A HAPPY AND A SAD THRILL THAT SHOOTS THROUGH A MAN AT SUCH AN
INSTANT. HAPPY AND JOYOUS AT HIS GIRL'S ARRIVAL AT MATURITY; SAD, AS
IT BRINGS TO MIND THAT AWKWARD FACT THAT HIS OWN YOUTH IS NOW BUT A
MYTH; AND THAT HIS SCALP IS SHOWING VACANT SPOTS. HIS BABY GIRL IN A
BRIDAL GOWN! HIS BABY GIRL A MATRON! HIS BABY GIRL PROUDLY PLACING A
_GRANDCHILD_ IN HIS LAP!! IT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY!! BUT THIS BIG WORLD
IS FULL OF THIS KIND OF IMPOSSIBILITY, AND WILL STAY SO AS LONG AS MAN
LASTS.

SO NANCY, TINY, HAPPY, LAUGHING NANCY, WAS "FOUND" THROUGH A CONSPIRACY
BY DAN CUPID AND FRANK MORGAN; AND RIGHT IN ALL GLORY OF YOUTH.
_YOUTH!!_ AH, WHAT A WORD!! AND HOW TRANSITORY! BUT, HOW GRAND! AS LONG
AS IT LASTS. HOW MANY MILLIONS IN GOLD WOULD POUR OUT FOR AN ABILITY TO
CALL IT ALL BACK, AS WITH OUR MUSICAL MYTH, FAUST. DURING THAT MAGIC
PART OF A CHILD'S GROWTH THIS WORLD IS JUST A GIGANTIC INQUIRY BOX,
CONTAINING MANY A TOPIC FOR WHICH A SOLUTION IS PARAMOUNT TO A GROWING
MIND. AND TO WHOM CAN A CHILD LOOK, BUT US ADULTS? ANY MAN WHO "CAN'T
STOP NOW" TO TALK WITH A CHILD UPON A TOPIC WHICH, TO HIM IS "TOO SILLY
FOR ANYTHING," SHOULD LOOK BACK TO THAT DAY UPON WHICH _THAT_ TOPIC
WAS DARK AND DUBIOUS IN HIS OWN BRAIN. A CHILD WHO ASKS NOTHING WILL
KNOW NOTHING. THAT IS WHY THAT "BUMP OF INQUIRY" WAS PUT ON TOP OF OUR
SKULLS.
