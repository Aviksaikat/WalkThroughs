NOW, AS OUR ORGANIZATION OF YOUTH IS RAPIDLY GROWING UP, A _YOUNG_
CROWD, TOO YOUNG TO JOIN IT AT FIRST, IS COMING UP; IMBIBING ITS
"WHY-NOT-DO-IT-NOW?" SPIRIT. SO, AS GADSBY STOOD IN FRONT OF THAT BIG
MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM (WHICH THAT GROUP, YOU KNOW, HAD HAD BUILT),
MARIAN HOPKINS, A SMALL GIRL, IN PASSING BY, SAW HIM, AND SAID:--

"I THINK BRANTON HILLS OUGHT TO BUY A BALLOON."

"BALLOON? BALLOON? WHAT WOULD THIS CITY DO WITH A BALLOON? PUT A STRING
ON IT SO YOU COULD RUN AROUND WITH IT?"

"NO; NOT THAT KIND OF A BALLOON, BUT THAT BIG, ZOOMING KIND THAT SAILS
WAY UP HIGH, WITH A MAN IN IT."

"OH! HA, HA! YOU THINK AN AIR-CRAFT IS A BALLOON! BUT WHAT WOULD--AHA!
AN AIRPORT?"

"UH-HUH; BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT."

"BY CRACKY!" SAID HIS HONOR. "I THOUGHT THIS TOWN WAS ABOUT THROUGH
IMPROVING. BUT AN AIRPORT _WOULD_ ADD A BIT TO IT; NOW WOULDN'T IT?"

MARIAN HAD A MOST PROFOUND OPINION THAT IT WOULD; (IF PROFOUND OPINIONS
GROW IN SUCH SMALL KIDS!) SO BOTH TOOK A WALK TO CITY HALL TO HUNT UP
A COUNCILMAN OR TWO. FINDING FOUR IN A COUNCIL ROOM, GADSBY SAID:--

"YOUTH, OR, I SHOULD SAY, CHILDHOOD, HAS JUST SHOWN THAT BRANTON HILLS
IS SHY ON A MOST IMPORTANT ACQUISITION," AND OLD BILL SIMPKINS JUST
_HAD_ TO BLURT OUT:--

"AND, NATURALLY, IT CALLS FOR CASH! CASH! CASH! CASH!! WHAT WILL THIS
TOWN AMOUNT TO IF IT BLOWS IN DOLLARS SO FAST?"

"AND," SAID GADSBY, "WHAT WILL IT AMOUNT TO, IF IT DON'T?"

THAT PUT A GAG ON OLD BILL. COUNCILMAN BANKS, THOUGH, WAS CURIOUS TO
KNOW ABOUT MARIAN'S PROPOSITION, SAYING:--

"IT IS PROBABLY A PLAN FOR BUYING CHRISTMAS TOYS FOR ALL BRANTON HILLS
KIDS."

BUT TINY MARIAN, WITH A VIGOROUS STAMP OF A TINY FOOT, SWUNG RIGHT BACK
WITH:--

"NO, SIR!! SANTA CLAUS WILL BRING US OUR GIFTS! BUT I THOUGHT OF HAVING
A--WHAT DID YOU CALL IT, MAYOR GADSBY?"

"THIS CHILD THINKS BRANTON HILLS SHOULD BUILD AN AIRPORT, AND I THINK
SO, TOO. IF OUR INHABITANTS, SUCH AS THIS TOT, CAN THINK UP SUCH
THINGS, ALL ADULTS SHOULD PACK UP, AND VANISH FROM MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS.
ALL RIGHT, MARIAN; OUR CITY COUNCIL, _YOUR_ CITY COUNCIL, MY YOUNG
PATRIOT, WILL LOOK INTO THIS AIRPORT PLAN FOR YOU."

SO, AS ON SIMILAR OCCASIONS MONTHS AGO, WORD THAT LAND WAS AGAIN
CROPPING UP IN GADSBY'S MIND, BROUGHT OUT A FLOOD OF LANDLORDS WITH
VACANT LOTS, ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO DISPOSING OF A DUMP WORTH TWO
DOLLARS AND A HALF, FOR FIFTY THOUSAND. NOW AN AIRPORT MUST OCCUPY A
VAST LOT OF LAND, SO CANNOT STAND RIGHT IN A CITY'S SHOPPING DISTRICT;
BUT FINALLY A BIG TRACT WAS BOUGHT, AND RIGHT IN BACK OF TINY MARIAN'S
BACK YARD! INSTANTLY, CITY HALL WAS FULL OF APPLICANTS FOR FLYING
BRANTON HILLS' FIRST AIRCRAFT. TO GADSBY'S JOY, AMONGST THAT BUNCH WAS
HAROLD THOMPSON, AN OLD ORGANIZATION LAD, WHO WAS KNOWN AROUND TOWN AS
A CHAP WHO COULD DO ABOUT ANYTHING CALLING FOR BRAINS. AS AN AIRPORT
IS NOT LAID OUT IN A DAY, HAROLD GOT BUSY WITH PAID AVIATORS AND SOON
WAS PILOTING A CRAFT WITHOUT AID; AND NOT ONLY BRANTON HILLS FOLKS, BUT
OLD AVIATORS, SAW IN HAROLD, A "BIRD-MAN" OF NO SMALL ABILITY. AND SO
TINY MARIAN'S "VISION" WAS A FACT; JUST AS "BIG GIRL" LUCY'S ZOO; AND,
AS WITH ALL BIG CITY AFFAIRS, AN INAUGURATION SHOULD START IT OFF. NOW,
ON ALL SUCH AFFAIRS YOU ALWAYS FIND A "VISITOR OF HONOR"; AND ON THIS
GRAND DAY GADSBY COULDN'T THINK OF ANYBODY FOR THAT IMPORTANT POST BUT
MARIAN. AND, AS IT WOULD OCCUR IN AUGUST, ANY DAY WOULD DO, AS THAT IS
A SCHOOL VACATION MONTH.

AND WHAT A _MOB_ STOOD, OR SAT, ON THAT BIG AIRPORT, WAITING FOR A
SIGNAL FROM YOUNG MARIAN WHICH WOULD START HAROLD ALOFT, ON BRANTON
HILLS' INITIAL FLIGHT! ALMOST ALL BROUGHT A LUNCH AND CAMP-STOOLS OR
FOLDING CHAIRS; AND, AS IT WAS A HOT DAY, THOUSANDS OF GAY PARASOLS,
AND AN ARRAY OF BRIGHT CLOTHING ON OUR SCHOOL-GIRLS, HAD THAT BIG LOT
LOOKING AS BRILLIANT AS A FLORIST'S WINDOW AT CHRISTMAS.

OUR YOUNG VISITOR OF HONOR WAS ALL AGOG WITH JOY; AND, I THINK,
POSSIBLY A TOUCH OF VANITY; FOR WHAT CHILD _WOULDN'T_ THRILL WITH
THOUSANDS WATCHING? BUT THOUGH MARIAN HAD ALWAYS HAD GOOD CLOTHING,
COMING FROM A FAMILY WHO COULD AFFORD IT, _NO_ TOT, IN ALL HISTORY, HAD
SO GLORIOUS AN OUTFIT AS THAT WHICH ABOUT ALL BRANTON HILLS' POPULATION
SAW ON THAT PLATFORM, AMIDST FLAGS, BUNTING AND OUR BIG MUNICIPAL BAND.
AS AN AIRSHIP IS A SIMULATION OF A BIRD; AND AS A BIRD, TO A CHILD, IS
NOT FAR FROM A FAIRY, MARIAN HAD GAUDY FAIRY WINGS, A RADIANT CLOAK OF
GOLD, A SPARKLING GOWN ALL AGLOW WITH TWINKLING STARS, AND A LONG GLASS
WAND, WITH A STAR AT ITS TOP. AS SOON AS ALL WAS IN CONDITION GADSBY
TOLD MARIAN TO STAND UP. THIS BROUGHT THAT VAST CROWD UP, ALSO; AND
GADSBY SAID:--

"NOW HOLD YOUR WAND WAY UP HIGH, AND SWING IT, TO SIGNAL HAROLD TO
START."

UP SHOT A TINY ARM; AND HAROLD, WATCHING FROM HIS COCKPIT, SANG
OUT:--"CONTACT!!"

A VIGOROUS TWIST OF HIS SHIP'S GIGANTIC "FAN" A SHOUT, A ROAR, A WHIZZ,
A MIGHTY CLOUD OF DUST, AND AMID A TORNADO OF CLAPPING, SHOUTS, AND
BAND MUSIC, BRANTON HILLS WAS PUT ON AVIATION'S MAP. WAY, WAY UP, SO
FAR AS TO LOOK AS SMALL AS A TOY, HAROLD PUT ON A SHOW OF BANKING,
ROLLING AND DIVING, WHICH TOLD GADSBY THAT, STILL AGAIN, HAD BRANTON
HILLS FOUND PROFIT IN WHAT ITS ORGANIZATION OF YOUTH, _AND, NOW, ITS
SMALL KIDS_, HAD TO SAY ABOUT IMPROVING A TOWN.

DURING THAT BOX-LUNCH PICNIC, MANY OF OUR "BIG GIRLS" BROUGHT SO MUCH
FOOD TO MARIAN THAT DAD AND MA HAD TO STAND GUARD AGAINST TUMMY PAINS.
AND WHAT A GLORIOUS, JOLLY OCCASION THAT PICNIC WAS! GAY BAND MUSIC,
SONGS, DANCING, ORATORY; AND A GRAND ALL-ROUND "HOWDY" AMONGST OLD
INHABITANTS AND ARRIVING TOURISTS SOON WAS TRANSFORMING THAT BIG CROWD
INTO A HAPPY GROUP, SUCH AS IT IS HARD TO FIND, TODAY, IN ANY BIG CITY;
COLD, DISTANT, AND WITH NO THOUGHT BY ITS POLITICIANS FOR ANYBODY IN
IT; AND GADSBY FOUND, AROUND THAT BIG AIRPORT, MANY A MAN, WOMAN AND
CHILD WHO WAS AS PROUD OF HIM AS WAS HIS OWN FAMILY.
