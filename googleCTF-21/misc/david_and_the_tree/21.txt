BUT WHAT ABOUT BRANTON HILLS' MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS, RIGHT NOW? IN TWO
MONTHS IT WAS TO BALLOT ON WHO SHOULD SIT IN PAST-COUNCILMAN ANTOR'S
CHAIR; AND A CAMPAIGN WAS ON WHICH WAS ACTUALLY SIZZLING. AND IN
WHAT A CONTRAST TO OUR CITY'S START! FOR IT HAS GROWN RAPIDLY;
AND, IN COMPARISON TO THAT DAY UPON WHICH A THOUSAND BALLOTS WAS
A BIG OUT-POURING OF POPULAR CLAMOR NOW MANY POLITICIANS HAD CITY
HALL ASPIRATIONS. AND _WHO_ DO YOU THINK WAS RUNNING FOR COUNCIL,
NOW? WILLIAM GADSBY! POPULARLY KNOWN AS BILL! BILL, BRANTON HILLS'
FAMOUS DANDY; BILL, THAT CONSUMMATION OF ALL BRANTON HILLS GIRLS'
MOST ROMANTIC WISH; BILL, THAT "OUTDOOR PART" OF BRANTON HILLS' MOST
ARISTOCRATIC TAILOR SHOP! NATURALLY, OPPOSING GROUPS FOUGHT FOR THAT
VACANCY; PART OF OUR POPULATION CLAMORING LOUDLY FOR BILL, BUT WITH
MANY JUST AS STRONGLY AGAINST HIM. SO IT WAS:--

"PUT BILL GADSBY IN!! BILL HAS ALL OUR MAYOR'S GOOD POINTS! BILL WILL
WORK FOR ALL THAT IS UPRIGHT AND GOOD!"

AND ALSO:--

"_WHAT!_ BILL GADSBY? IS THIS TOWN PLUMB CRAZY? SAY! IF YOU PUT THAT
FOP IN CITY HALL YOU'LL FIND ALL ITS RAILINGS FLAPPING WITH PINK SATIN
RIBBONS; A JANITOR AT ITS MAIN DOOR, SQUIRTING VANILLA ON ALL WHO GO
IN; AND ITS FRONT LAWN WILL TURN INTO A PANSY FARM! PUT A _MAN_ IN CITY
HALL, NOT A SISSY WHO THINKS OUT 'UPSY-DOWNSY, INSY-OUTSY' CAMPING
SUITS FOR GIRLS!"

BUT THOUGH THIS DIDN'T ANNOY BILL, IT _DID_ STIR UP NANCY, WITH:--

"OH! THAT'S JUST AN ABOMINATION! _SUCH_ TALK ABOUT SO GRAND A YOUNG
CHAP! BUT I JUST SAW A BILLBOARD WITH A SIGN SAYING: 'BILL GADSBY FOR
COUNCIL;' SO, PROBABLY I SHOULDN'T WORRY, FOR BILL IS AS GOOD AS IN."

"BABY," SAID GADSBY, KINDLY, "THAT'S ONLY A BILLBOARD, AND BILLBOARDS
DON'T PUT A MAN IN CITY HALL. IT'S _BALLOTS_, DARLING; _THOUSANDS_ OF
BALLOTS, THAT FILL COUNCIL CHAIRS."

"BUT, DADDY, I'M GOING TO ROOT FOR BILL. I'LL STAND UP ON A STUMP, OR
IN A TIP-CART, OR----"

"WHOA! WAIT A BIT!" AND GADSBY SAT DOWN BY HIS "BABY GIRL," SAYING:
"YOU CAN'T GO ON A STUMPING CAMPAIGN WITHOUT KNOWING A LOT ABOUT
MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS; WHICH YOU DON'T. ANY ANTAGONIST WHO KNOWS ABOUT
SUCH THINGS WOULD OUT-TALK YOU WITHOUT HALF TRYING. NO, DARLING, THIS
POLITICAL STUFF IS TOO BIG FOR YOU. YOU JUST LOOK OUT FOR THINGS IN
THAT SMALL BUNGALOW OF YOURS, AND ALLOW BRANTON HILLS TO FIGHT TO PUT
BILL IN. YOU KNOW MY OLD SLOGAN:--'MAN AT A CITY'S FRONT; WOMAN AT A
CABIN DOOR.'"

AND NANCY, FONDLY STROKING HIS HAND, SAID:

"MAN AT A CITY'S FRONT! WHAT A GRAND POST FOR A MAN! A CITY, A BIG,
RUSHING, DASHING, SLAMMING, BANGING, BOILING MASS OF HUMANITY! A CITY;
WITH ITS BRIGHT, HAPPY, SUNNY PARKS; AND ITS SAD, DARK SLUMS; ITS RICH
MANSIONS AND ITS SHANTY-TOWN SHACKS; ITS SHOPS, INNS, SHOWS, COURTS,
AIRPORTS, RAILWAY STATIONS, HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, CHURCH GROUPS, SOCIAL
CLUBS, AND,--AND,--_OH!_ _WHAT_ A MAGIC VISUALIZATION OF HUMAN THOUGHT
IT IS! BUT IT IS AS A SMALL CHILD. IT LOOKS FOR A STRONG ARM TO SUPPORT
ITS FIRST TODDLINGS; FOR ADULT MINDS TO PILOT IT AROUND MANY PITFALLS;
AND ONWARD, _ONWARD!!_ TO A SHINING GOAL!!" AND NANCY'S CROWN OF RICH
BROWN HAIR SANK LOVINGLY IN GADSBY'S LAP.

DURING THIS OUTBURST GADSBY HAD SAT DUMB; BUT FINALLY SAYING, PROUDLY:--

"SO, HO! MY BABY GIRL HAS GROWN UP! DOLLS AND SAND-DIGGING TOOLS
DON'T CALL, AS OF OLD. AND SMALL, DIRTY PAWS, AND A TINY SMUDGY CHIN,
TRANSFORM, ALMOST IN A TWINKLING INTO CHARMING HANDS AND A CHIN OF
MATURITY. MY, MY! IT WAS BUT A MONTH OR TWO AGO THAT YOU, IN PIG-TAILS
AND GINGHAM----"

"NO, DADDY! IT WAS A _MIGHTY LONG_ MONTH OR TWO AGO; AND IT'S NOT
PIG-TAILS AND GINGHAM, NOW, BUT A HUSBAND AND A BABY."

"ALL RIGHT, KID; BUT AS YOU GROW OLD, YOU'LL FIND THAT, IN GLANCING
BACKWARDS, MONTHS LOOK MIGHTY SHORT; AND SMALL TOTS GROW UP, ALMOST IN
A NIGHT. A MONTH _FROM NOW_ LOOKS AWFULLY FAR OFF; BUT _LAST MONTH_?
PFF! THAT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT!"

THUS DID NANCY AND HIS HONOR TALK, UNTIL A VIGOROUS HONKING AT HIS CURB
TOLD OF FRANK, "LOOKING FOR A COOK," FOR IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK.
