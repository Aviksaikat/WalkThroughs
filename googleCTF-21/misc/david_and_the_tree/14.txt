AS THIS IS A HISTORY OF A CITY I MUST NOT STAY AROUND ANY PART TOO
LONG. SO, AS IT WAS ALMOST "A SMALL MORNING HOUR," NINA ADAMS, A WIDOW,
WAS SITTING UP; FOR VIRGINIA, A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL, WAS STILL OUT; AND,
AROUND TWO-THIRTY, WAS BROUGHT BACK IN A FAST CAR; TWO YOUTHS ACTUALLY
_DUMPING_ AN UNCONSCIOUS FORM ON NINA'S FRONT PORCH, AND DASHING
MADLY AWAY. BUT NINA ADAMS SAW IT; AND, CALLING FOR AID IN CARRYING
VIRGINIA INDOORS, PUT IN A FRANTIC CALL FOR OLD DOC WILKINS, AN OLD,
LONG-AGO SCHOOL PAL, WHO FOUND NINA FRANTIC FROM NOT KNOWING VIRGINIA'S
CONDITION, NOR WHY THE PAIR OF YOUTHS SHOT MADLY AWAY WITHOUT CALLING
ANYBODY. BUT IT ONLY TOOK DOCTOR WILKINS AN INSTANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
WAS WRONG; AND NINA, NOTING HIS TIGHT LIPS AND GROWING SCOWL WAS IN AN
AGONY OF DOUBT.

"WHAT _IS_ IT, TOM? _QUICK!!_ I'M ALMOST CRAZY!!"

DR. WILKINS, STANDING BY VIRGINIA'S COUCH, SAID, SLOWLY:--

"IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, NINA. VIRGINIA WILL PULL THROUGH ALL
RIGHT, BY MORNING."

BUT THAT DIDN'T SATISFY NINA ADAMS, _NOT FOR AN INSTANT_, AND DR.
WILKINS, KNOWING THAT IRONCLAD SPIRIT OF SCHOOL DAYS WHICH WOULD STAND
FOR NO OBSTRUCTIONS IN ITS PATH, SAW THAT A "BLOW-UP" WAS COMING; BUT,
THROUGH A KINDLY THOUGHT FOR THIS WOMAN'S COMFORT, DID NOT SAY WHAT HIS
DIAGNOSIS WAS, UNTIL NINA, NOW ACTUALLY LIVID WITH WORRY, SAID:--

"TOM WILKINS! _DOCTOR_ WILKINS, IF YOU WISH,--I CLAIM A NATURAL RIGHT
TO KNOW WHY MY CHILD IS UNCONSCIOUS! AND YOU, A PHYSICIAN, CANNOT, BY
LAW, WITHHOLD SUCH INFORMATION!!"

BUT WILKINS, TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF A MOST UNHAPPY CONDITION OF
AFFAIRS, SAID:--

"NOW, NINA, YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T HOLD ANYTHING FROM YOU IF VIRGINIA WAS
CRITICALLY ILL, BUT THAT IS NOT SO. IF YOU'LL ONLY WAIT UNTIL MORNING
YOU'LL FIND THAT I AM RIGHT."

BUT THIS ONLY BUILT OBSTRUCTION UPON OBSTRUCTION TO NINA'S STRONG WILL,
UNTIL DR. WILKINS, NOTICING COMING TOTAL PROSTRATION, HAD TO SAY:--

"NINA, VIRGINIA IS _DRUNK_; _HORRIBLY_ DRUNK."

"_DRUNK!!_" WIDOW ADAMS HAD TO GRAB WILDLY AT A CHAIR, SINKING INTO IT;
AT FIRST AS LIMP AS A RAG, BUT INSTANTLY SPRINGING UP, BLOOD SURGING TO
A THROBBING BROW. "_DRUNK!_ _DRUNK!!_ _MY_ BABY DRUNK!! TOM, I THANK
YOU FOR TRYING TO WARD OFF THIS SHOCK; BUT I'LL SAY RIGHT NOW, _WITH MY
HAND ON HIGH_, THAT I AM GOING TO START A RUMPUS ABOUT THIS ATROCITY
THAT WILL ROCK BRANTON HILLS TO ITS FOUNDATIONS! WHO _GOT_ THIS YOUNG
SCHOOL-GIRL DRUNK? I KNOW THAT VIRGINIA WOULDN'T DRINK THAT STUFF
WILLINGLY. HOW _COULD_ IT OCCUR? I PAY THROUGH TAXATION FOR A PATROLMAN
IN THIS DISTRICT; IN FACT IN _ALL_ DISTRICTS OF THIS CITY. WHAT IS
A PATROLMAN FOR, IF NOT TO WATCH FOR JUST SUCH ABOMINATIONS AS THIS,
PRAY?"

DR. WILKINS DIDN'T SAY, THOUGH PROBABLY THINKING OF A RUMOR THAT HAD
RUN AROUND TOWN FOR A MONTH OR TWO. AT THIS POINT VIRGINIA, PARTLY
CONSCIOUS, WAS MURMURING:--

"OH, NORMAN! _DON'T!!_ I _CAN'T_ DRINK IT! OH! I'M _SO_ SICK!!"

THIS BROUGHT FORTH ALL OF NINA ADAMS' FURY INSTANTLY.

"_AHA! AHA! NORMAN!_ SO _THAT'S_ IT! THAT'S NORMAN ANTOR, THAT
LOW-DOWN, GOOD-FOR-NOTHING NIGHT-OWL! SON OF OUR BIG COUNCILMAN ANTOR.
SO!! IT'S 'NORMAN! I CAN'T DRINK IT'! TOM WILKINS, THIS THING IS GOING
TO _COURT!!_"

       *       *       *       *       *

ABOUT NOON OF THAT DAY, OUR GOOD DOCTOR, WALKING SADLY ALONG, RAN
ACROSS MAYOR GADSBY, IN FRONT OF CITY HALL; AND DID HIS HONOR "_BURN_"
AT SUCH AN ABOMINATION?

"_WHAT?_ HIGH SCHOOL BOYS _FORCING_ YOUNG GIRLS TO DRINK? AND RIGHT IN
OUR GLORIOUS BRANTON HILLS? OH, BUT, DOC! THIS CAN'T PASS WITHOUT A
TRIAL!"

"THAT'S ALL RIGHT, JOHN; BUT A THORN STICKS OUT, RIGHT IN PLAIN SIGHT."

"THORN? THORN? WHAT KIND OF A THORN?" AND OUR MAYOR WAS FLUSHING HARD,
AS NO KIND OF WILD THOUGHTS WOULD POINT TO ANY KIND OF THORNS.

"THAT THORN," SAID WILKINS, "IS YOUNG NORMAN ANTOR; SON OF----"

"_NOT OF COUNCILMAN ANTOR?_"

"I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT IT IS SO," AND WILKINS TOLD OF VIRGINIA'S
HALF-CONSCIOUS MURMURINGS. "AND NINA WANTS TO KNOW WHY, WITH A
PATROLMAN IN ALL PARTS OF TOWN, IT ISN'T KNOWN THAT ALL THIS DRINKING
IS GOING ON. I DIDN'T SAY WHAT I THOUGHT, BUT YOU KNOW THAT A PATROLMAN
DON'T GO INTO DANCING PAVILIONS AND NIGHT CLUBS UNTIL CONDITIONS
SANCTION IT."

"WHO IS SUPPLYING THIS LIQUOR?"

"COUNCILMAN ANTOR; BUT WITHOUT KNOWING IT."

ALL HIS HONOR COULD SAY WAS TO GASP:--

"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, DOC?" AND WILKINS TOLD OF FOUR CALLS FOR HIM IN
FOUR DAYS, TO YOUNG GIRLS, SIMILARLY DRUNK.

"AND MY _FIRST_ CALL WAS TO YOUNG MARY--ANTOR'S TINY GRAMMAR SCHOOL
KID, WHO WAS AS DRUNK AS VIRGINIA; BUT, ON COMING OUT OF IT, TOLD OF
ROBBING ANTOR'S PANTRY, IN WHICH LIQUOR WAS ALWAYS ON HAND FOR HIS
POLITICAL PALS, YOU KNOW; THAT POOR KID TAKING IT TO VARIOUS AFFAIRS
AND GIVING IT TO BOYS; AND WINNING 'POPULARITY' THAT WAY."

"SO," SAID GADSBY, "COUNCILMAN ANTOR'S BOY AND GIRL, BROUGHT UP IN
A FAMILY WITH LIQUOR ALWAYS HANDY, NOW, WITH IGNORANT, CHILDISH
BRAGGADOCIO, BRING COUNCILMAN ANTOR INTO THIS MIX-UP! I'M SORRY FOR
ANTOR; BUT HIS PANTRY IS IN FOR AN OFFICIAL VISIT."

IT WASN'T SO LONG FROM THIS DAY THAT COURT GOT AROUND TO THIS RUMPUS.
TO SAY THAT THAT BIG ROOM WAS _FULL_, WOULD PUT IT MILDLY. ALTHOUGH,
ACCORDING TO AN OLD SAYING, "A CAT IS ONLY AS BIG AS ITS SKIN," THAT
ROOM'S WALLS ALMOST BURST, AS GROUPS OF CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS AND LAW
ABIDING INHABITANTS ALMOST FOUGHT FOR ADMISSION; UNTIL STANDING ROOM
WAS NOTHING BUT A SUFFOCATING JAM. AS GADSBY AND DOC WILKINS SAT
WATCHING THAT SIGHT, GADSBY SAID:--

"IT'S AN OUTPOURING OF RIGHTFUL WRATH BY A PROUD CITY'S POPULATION;
WHO, HAVING PUT OUT GOOD, HARD WORK IN BRINGING IT TO ITS HIGH
STANDING AS A COMMUNITY, TODAY, WILL NOT STAND FOR ANYTHING THAT WILL
PUT A BLOT ON ITS MUNICIPAL FLAG, WHICH IS, RIGHT NOW, PROUDLY FLYING
ON CITY HALL."

AS WILKINS WAS ABOUT TO SAY SO, A RISING MURMUR WAS ROLLING IN FROM OUT
BACK, FOR NORMAN ANTOR WAS COMING IN, IN CUSTODY OF A BIG PATROLMAN,
AND WITH FOUR YOUTHS, ALL LOOKING, NOT ONLY ANXIOUS, BUT PLAINLY
SHOWING HUMILIATION AT SUCH AN ABOMINATION AGAINST TRUSTING YOUNG
GIRLHOOD. SCOWLS AND ANGRY RUMBLINGS TOLD THAT HIGH OFFICIAL, WAY UP IN
BACK OF THAT MAHOGANY RAILING, THAT BUT A SPARK WOULD START A RIOT. SO,
IN A CALM, ALMOST UNCANNY WAY, THIS FIRST TRIAL OF ITS KIND IN BRANTON
HILLS GOT ALONG TO A COURT OFFICIAL CALLING, LOUDLY:--

"VIRGINIA ADAMS!!"

IF YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHAT A TOTALLY STILL ROOM IS, BY NO KINK
OF YOUR IMAGINATION COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW SUCH AN AWFUL, FRIGHTFUL
_HUSH_ AS STRUCK THAT CROWD DUMB, AS VIRGINIA, A TALL, DARK, WILLOWY,
STYLISH GIRL QUICKLY TOOK THAT CHAIR, FROM WHICH TRUTH, IN ALL ITS
PURITY, IS CUSTOMARILY BROUGHT OUT. BUT VIRGINIA WAS NOT A BIT SHAKY
NOR ANXIOUS, NOR DOUBTFUL OF AN ABILITY TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS UGLY
TASK.

GADSBY AND DOC WILKINS SAT WATCHING NINA; GADSBY WITH PROFOUND
SYMPATHY, BUT WILKINS WITH AN OLD SCHOOL-PAL'S INTUITION, WATCHING
FOR A BLOW-UP. BUT NINA DIDN'T BLOW UP, THAT IS, NOT VISIBLY; BUT THAT
FAMOUS RIGID WILL WAS BOILING, FULL TILT; BOILING UP TO A POINT FOR
LANDING, "TOOTH AND CLAW" ON OUR POMPOUS COUNCILMAN'S SON, IF THINGS
DIDN'T TURN OUT SATISFACTORILY.

VIRGINIA DIDN'T OCCUPY THAT STAND LONG; IT WAS ONLY A HALF-SOBBING
ACCOUNT OF A NIGHT AT A DANCING PAVILION; AND WITH A SOB OR TWO FROM A
WOMAN OR GIRL IN THAT VAST CROWD. ALL VIRGINIA SAID WAS:--

"NORMAN ANTOR SAID I WAS A CRY-BABY IF I WOULDN'T DRINK WITH HIM.
BUT I SAID, 'ALL RIGHT; I _AM_ A CRY-BABY! AND I ALWAYS _WILL_ TURN
'CRY-BABY' IF ANYBODY INSISTS THAT I DRINK THAT STUFF.'" (JUST A SHORT
LULL, A VALIANT FIGHT FOR CONTROL, AND)--"BUT I _HAD_ TO DRINK!! NORMAN
WAS TIPPING MY CHAIR BACK AND JOHN ALLISON WAS FORCING THAT GLASS INTO
MY MOUTH! I GOT SO SICK I COULDN'T STAND UP, AND DIDN'T KNOW A THING
UNTIL I FOUND I WAS ON A COUCH IN MY OWN PARLOR."

A COURT OFFICIAL SAID, KINDLY:--

"THAT WILL DO, MISS ADAMS."

DURING THIS, NINA WAS GLARING AT NORMAN; BUT VIRGINIA'S BRINGING
ALLISON INTO IT, ALSO, WAS TOO MUCH. BUT WILKINS, WATCHING NARROWLY,
SAID, SNAPPINGLY:--

"_NINA!_ THIS IS A _COURT ROOM_."

NOW THIS TRIAL WAS TOO LONG TO GO INTO, WORD FOR WORD; SO I'LL SAY
THAT NOT ONLY NORMAN ANTOR AND ALLISON, BUT ALSO OUR BIG, POMPOUS
COUNCILMAN ANTOR, ACCORDING TO OUR POPULAR SLANG, "GOT IN BAD"; AND
BRANTON HILLS' DANCING AND NIGHT SPOTS GOT WORD TO PROHIBIT LIQUOR
OR SHUT UP SHOP. YOUNG MARY ANTOR WAS SHOWN THAT LIQUOR, IN DANCING
PAVILIONS OR IN A FAMILY PANTRY WAS NOT GOOD FOR YOUNG GIRLS; AND SOON
THIS MOST DISGUSTING AFFAIR WAS A PART OF BRANTON HILLS' HISTORY. AND
WHAT VAST VARIATIONS A CITY'S HISTORY CONTAINS! WHAT VALOROUS ACTS BY
FAR-THINKING OFFICIALS! WHAT DARK DAUBS OF FILTH BY AVARICIOUS CROOKS!
WHAT AN ARRAY OF PAST MAYORS; WHAT FINANCIAL UPS AND DOWNS; WHAT GROWTH
IN POPULATION. BUT, AS I AM THIS PARTICULAR CITY'S HISTORIAN, _WITH
STRICT ORTHOGRAPHY CONTROLLING IT_, THIS HISTORY WILL NOT RANK, IN
VOLUBILITY, WITH ANY BY AN AUTHOR WHO CAN SOW, BROADCAST, ALL HANDY,
COMMON WORDS WHICH _CONTINUOUSLY_ TRY TO JUMP INTO IT!
