ANY MAN WITH SO KINDLY A DISPOSITION TOWARD YOUTH AS HAS BROUGHT OUR
MAYOR FORWARD IN BRANTON HILLS' HISTORY, MAY, WITHOUT WARNING, RUN
ACROSS AN OCCASION WHICH HOLDS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDING A BIT OF JOY
IN LIVING. SO, AS GADSBY STOOD, ON A CHILLY FALL DAY, IN FRONT OF THAT
BIG GLASS BUILDING WHICH WAS BUILT FOR A CITY FLORIST, ADMIRING A
CHARMING DISPLAY OF BLOSSOMING PLANTS, A SMALL GIRL, STILL IN GRAMMAR
SCHOOL, SAID, SHYLY:--

"HULLOA."

"HULLOA, YOU. SCHOOL OUT?"

"ON SATURDAYS, SCHOOL IS ALWAYS OUT."

"THAT'S SO; IT _IS_ SATURDAY, ISN'T IT? GOING IN?"

"_IN!!_ MY, NO! _I_ CAN'T GO INTO THAT FAIRYLAND!"

"NO? WHY NOT, PRAY?"

"AW! I DUNNO; BUT NOBODY HAS TOOK KIDS IN."

"TOOK? TOOK? SAY, YOUNG LADY, YOU MUST STUDY YOUR GRAMMAR BOOK. BRANTON
HILLS SCHOOLS DON'T----"

"UH-HUH; I KNOW. BUT A KID JUST CAN'T--"

"BY GOLLY! A KID _CAN!_ GRAB MY HAND."

NOW, MANY A FAIRY BOOK HAS TOLD, IN GLOWING WORDS, OF CHILDHOOD'S JOYS
AND THRILLS AT AMAZING SIGHTS; BUT _NO_ FAIRY BOOK _COULD_ SHOW, IN
COLD PRINT, WHAT GADSBY RAN UP AGAINST AS THAT BIG DOOR SHUT, AND A
CHILD STOOD STOCK STILL--AND _DUMB!_ TWO SMALL ARMS HUNG LIMPLY DOWN,
AGAINST A POOR, OH, _SO_ POOR SKIRT; AND TWO BIG STARING BROWN ORBS
TOOK IN THAT VISION OF FLORAL GLORY, WHICH IS FOUND IN JUST THAT KIND
OF A BIG GLASS BUILDING ON A COLD, RAW AUTUMN DAY.

GADSBY SAID NOT A WORD; SLOWLY STROLLING DOWN A PATH AMIDST THOUSANDS
OF GLADIOLI; AROUND A TURN, AND UP A PATH, ALONG WHICH STOOD POTS AND
POTS OF FUCHSIAS, SALVIAS AND CANNAS; AND TO A CROSS-PATH, DOWN WHICH
WAS A BIG FLAT PANSY PATCH, TUBS OF BLOSSOMING LILACS, AND STIFF,
STRAIGHT CARNATIONS. NOT A WORD FROM GADSBY, FOR HIS MIND WAS ON THAT
SMALL BUNCH OF RAPTUROUS JOY JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. BUT, FINALLY, JUST
TO PRY A BIT INTO THAT BABY MIND, HIS HONOR SAID:--

"LOOKS KIND OF GOOD, DON'T IT?"

A TINY FORM SHRUNK DOWN ABOUT AN INCH; AND AN ALSO TINY BOSOM, RISING
AND FALLING IN A THRALLDOM OF BLISS, FINALLY PUT FORTH A LONG, LONG,--

"_O-H-H-H-H!!_"

IT WAS SO LONG THAT GADSBY WAS IN A QUANDARY AS TO HOW SUCH SMALL LUNGS
COULD HOLD IT.

NOW IN WATCHING THIS TOT THRILLING AT ITS FIRST VISIT TO SUCH A WORLD
OF FLORAL GLORY, GADSBY GOT WHAT BOYS CALL "A HUNCH;" AND SAID:--

"YOU DON'T FIND BLOSSOMS IN YOUR YARD THIS MONTH, _DO_ YOU?"

IF YOU KNOW CHILDHOOD YOU KNOW THAT THRILLS DON'T LAST LONG WITHOUT A
CALL FOR INFORMATION. AND GADSBY GOT SUCH A CALL, WITH:--

"NO, SIR. IS THIS GOD'S PARLOR?"

NOW GADSBY WOULDN'T, FOR ANYTHING, SPOIL A CHILDISH THOUGHT; SO SAID,
KINDLY:--

"IT'S PART OF IT. GOD'S PARLOR IS AWFULLY BIG, YOU KNOW."

"_MY_ PARLOR IS AWFULLY _SMALL_; AND NOT ANY BLOSS---- OH! WOULDN'T
GOD----?"

GADSBY'S HUNCH WAS NOW WORKING, FULL TILT; AND SO, AS THIS LOVING
FAMILY MAN, HAVING HAD FOUR KIDS OF HIS OWN, AND THIS TOT FROM A POOR
FAMILY WITH ITS "AWFULLY SMALL" PARLOR,--HAD TROD THIS BIG GLASS
BUILDING'S PATHS AGAIN AND AGAIN; ROUND AND ROUND, AN ALMOST MONSTROUS
SIGH FROM AN ALMOST BURSTING TINY BOSOM, SAID:--

"I'LL THINK OF GOD'S PARLOR, ALWAYS AND ALWAYS AND _ALWAYS!!_" AND
GADSBY, ON GLANCING UPWARDS, SAW A DISTINCT DROOPING AND CURVING OF
MANY STALKS; WHICH IS A PLANT'S WAY OF BOWING TO A CHILD. AND, AT
BRANTON HILLS' FOLLOWING COUNCIL NIGHT A MOTION WAS---- BUT I SAID
GADSBY HAD A HUNCH. SO, NOT ONLY _THIS_ SCHOOLGIRL'S AWFULLY SMALL
PARLOR, BUT MANY SUCH THROUGHOUT BRANTON HILLS' POOR DISTRICTS, SOON
FOUND A "BIG GIRL" FROM GADSBY'S ORIGINAL ORGANIZATION OF YOUTH AT ITS
FRONT DOOR WITH PLANTS FROM THAT BIG GLASS BUILDING, IN WHICH OUR CITY
FLORIST WORKS IN GOD'S PARLOR. (P.S. _GO_ WITH A CHILD TO _YOUR_ CITY
FLORIST'S BIG GLASS BUILDING. IT'S A _DUTY!_)
