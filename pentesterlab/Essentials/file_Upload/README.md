## File Upload

-	In web applications (especially the ones using the file systems to determine what code should be run), you can get code execution on a server, if you manage to upload a file with the right filename (often depending on the extension). In this section, we will see the basics of these types of attacks.

First, since we are working on a PHP application, we will need a PHP web shell. A web shell is just a simple script or web application that runs the code or commands provided. For example, in PHP, the following code is a really simple web shell:
```php
<?php
  system($_GET["cmd"]);
?>
```
More complex web shells can perform advanced operations, such as providing database and file system access, or even TCP tunnelling.

The first example is a really basic upload form, with no restriction. By using the web shell above, and naming it with a .php extension you should be able to get it upload onto the server. Once it's uploaded, you can access the script (with the parameter cmd=uname for example) to get command execution.
