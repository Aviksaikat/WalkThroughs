## Command Execution

-	Commands injection can be used to run arbitrary commands on a server. Multiple 		payloads can be used to trigger this behaviour. For example, letâ€™s say that the 	initial command is:

	ping [parameter]

	Where [parameter] is the value you provided in the form or in the URL.

	If you look at how the command line works, you can find that there is multiple way to add more commands:

	    command1 && command2 that will run command2 if command1 succeeds.
	    command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.
	    command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.
	    command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2.
	    ...

	In this application, we can provide a parameter to command1, but there is no command2. What we are going to do is add our own command. Instead of sending the [parameter] to the command:

	ping 127.0.0.1

	Where 127.0.0.1 is our [parameter]. We are going to send a malicious [parameter] that will contain another command:

	ping 127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd

	The application will think that 127.0.0.1 ; cat /etc/passwd is just a parameter to run command1. But we actually injected command2: cat /etc/passwd.

	Now, what we want to do is run the command to score: /usr/local/bin/score [uuid]. We can just use the line above to run this command instead of cat /etc/passwd.
