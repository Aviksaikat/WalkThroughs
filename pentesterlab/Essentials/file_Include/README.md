## File Include

-	In a lot of applications, developers need to include files to load classes or 		to share some templates between multiple web pages.

	File include vulnerabilities come from a lack of filtering when a user-controlled parameter is used as part of a file name in a call to an including function (require, require_once, include or include_once in PHP for example). If the call to one of these methods is vulnerable, an attacker will be able to manipulate the function to load his own code. File include vulnerabilities can also be used as a directory traversal to read arbitrary files. However, if the arbitrary code contains an opening PHP tag, the file will be interpreted as PHP code.

	This including function can allow the loading of local resources or remote resource (a website, for example). If vulnerable, it will lead to:

	    Local File Include: LFI. A local file is read and interpreted.
	    Remote File Include: RFI. A remote file is retrieved and interpreted.

	By default, PHP disables loading of remote files, thanks to the configuration option: allow_url_include. In this lab, it has been enabled to allow you to test it.

	In this first example, you can see an error message, as soon as you inject a special character (a quote, for example) into the parameter:

	Warning: include(intro.php'): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/fileincl/example1.php on line 7 Warning: include(): Failed opening 'intro.php'' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/fileincl/example1.php on line 7

	If you read the error message carefully, you can extract a lot of information:

	    The path of the script: /var/www/fileincl/example1.php.
	    The function used: include().
	    The value used in the call to include is the value we injected intro.php' without any addition or filtering.

	We can use the methods used to detect directory traversal, to detect file include. For example, you can try to include /etc/passwd by using the ../ technique.

	We can test for Remote File Include, by requesting an external resource: https://pentesterlab.com/. We will see that the page from PentesterLab gets included inside the current page.

	PentesterLab's website also contains a test for this type of vulnerability. If you use the URL http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include.txt. You should get the result of the function phpinfo() within the current page:

	PHP include with phpinfo

	Finally, to score this exercise, you can either host your own malicious script or you can use this malicious file http://assets.pentesterlab.com/test_include_system.txt and add the command you want to run.
