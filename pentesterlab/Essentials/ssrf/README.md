## Server Side Request Forgery

-	A Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability allows an attacker to use a functionality of the web application to gain access to internal resources. Basically, we are going to get the server to make HTTP requests (or over protocols) on our behalf.

This can be used to access internal pages, perform network scans, trigger behaviours in different systems...

Here we will just try to retrieve the content of the webroot of a server listening on port TCP/1234. We can't access the service directly but we can get the vulnerable server to do it for us. To do so you will need to change the url parameter to access the local server on port TCP/1234.
